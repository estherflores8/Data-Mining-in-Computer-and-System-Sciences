# Data-Mining-in-Computer-and-System-Sciences
Welcome to the Data Mining in Computer and System Sciences Labs repository! This repository has guided me through the data mining process starting from data exploration, then moving on to clustering and classification, model evaluation, and finally model deployment.

## About

Data mining plays a crucial role in uncovering valuable insights, patterns, and trends from vast amounts of data. In the field of computer and system sciences, data mining techniques are applied to various domains such as network analysis, system optimization, machine learning, and more.

These labs were developed as part of the curriculum at Stockholm University and are structured to cover a range of topics related to data mining in computer and system sciences, including but not limited to:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Classification and regression
- Clustering and association rule mining
